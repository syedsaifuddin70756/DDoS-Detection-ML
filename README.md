DDoS Attack Detection using Machine Learning 🚀


📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks using Machine Learning. By analyzing network traffic patterns, we can classify whether an incoming request is normal or part of a malicious attack.

🔬 Dataset
The dataset contains various network traffic features, including:

Packet Flow Statistics (Flow Duration, Packet Length, etc.)
Header Information (SYN, ACK, FIN Flags)
Traffic Rates (Packets per second, Bytes per second)
⚙️ Model Used
The model is built using Random Forest Classifier, which provides high accuracy and robustness in detecting anomalies in network traffic.

📁 Files in This Repository
File	Description
Untitled1.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook containing the entire ML workflow
ddos_rf_model.pkl	Trained Machine Learning model
DNS-testing.csv	Test dataset used for evaluation
📊 Results
✅ Training Accuracy: ~82%
✅ Testing Accuracy: ~85%
The model effectively detects DDoS attacks while maintaining a balance between accuracy and generalization.
